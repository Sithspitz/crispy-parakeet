"1","Wow that looks so nice! It actually looks really tropical! are you at Worthing atm?"
"2","Yeah it's so nice, and yes am there now! It is very sunny all the time for some reason, the house is actually nearer to Littlehampton than Worthing, but cycled to Worthing earlier! Since having this new phone I have got quite into Instagram (fun and vaguely arty!) so this image is a bit, shall we call it, enhanced. :-P"
"3","Think me and Charlie are going to go to Bromley before Comedy Store, you are welcome to join but really really no pressure with work and all!!"
"4","I am unemployed so have nothing better to do haha!"
"5","Sun!"
"6","Also I just turned on Peaky Blinders for the first time, I heard the F Word 5 times in 30 seconds, then turned it off. Hahaha"
"7","Elgar!"
"8","Haha I'm loving the fact that you are sending me the pictures of Birmingham in instalments! How's your week going!"
"9","Instalments are fun! Did you work out where in Birmingham your dad is from? Was shit, but had a meeting and am reinvigorated!! You ready for Sunday?"
"10","I don't know which is better.."
"11","Haha I like the second one better! Oh my goshhhh so much to do for Sri Lanka - I'm starting to panic a little bit! Haha."
"12","And my dad's from Perry Bar and Grape Bar...does that mean anything to you!?"
"13","Have heard of Perry Bar but other than that I have no idea hahaha! Yeah I prefer the second one! Not long till Sri Lanka now.. Get moving üòú"
"14","Messages to this chat and calls are now secured with end-to-end encryption. Tap for more info."
"15","Hola from Sri Lanka! I finally have wifi as at an airport at the moment waiting for flight home!! Haha how are you doing? How's Birmingham? Still enjoying PhD? Xxx"
"16","Welcome home!! (although it doesn't feel like home anymore after everything that's happened in the last month, wish I wasn't in the country and were removed from it all)! Oh screw me and my philosophy degree! How are you?! Was Sri Lanka amazing? Were the people nice? So much to tell I bet! Where in the country even were you? Did you fly back with Srilankan Airlines by the way? Xxx"
"17","Yes I flew with srilankan airlines and they were great - one of the best flights I've ever had! I was living in the south of the country near.l Colombo but had to travel around a lot - the country was beautiful! Oh my gosh I know - I can't believe what has happened over the last four weeks - I think I should have just stayed in Sri Lanka! So now we have an unelected prime minister, we are no longer in Europe and we have an idiot as foreign secretary....ummm!?! Haha wow has it turned out to be more philosophy than science!? So much to catch up on hope we can meet up at some point soon! Xxx"
"18","Welcome to the 'democratic' UK... I consider myself European not English and feel awful now. Ah! I had a look at flights to London last night and think I found and followed the end of your flight from over Ghent to Heathrow, did you land at 19:20? Hehe! Screw this county, I have to get out. Wow, I really wanna hear all about it!! So glad you got to Sri Lanka in the end after last year! üòä It's a tiny country right though? What are you up to now for the rest of the summer? You did tell me but can't quite remember! Did you say you were going to fringe? Because I am going too now am well excited! Well there isn't such a thing as a doctor of science hehe, and to be fair work's been great recently, I just am feeling so so driven! Have had the most creative two weeks of my life, have had to come up with a ""story"" and has taken a lot of thinking and reading and creative energy! Been great! And apparently I have become kind of renowned in the department, random professors are trying to recruit me and people I have never met before keep coming up to me and talking about my work (basically am getting a big head and am trying to bring myself back down haha!) Am fairly busy but may come down to London for a day or so! Xxx"
"19","Wow it sounds like it is all really happening for you! That sounds so great Rich I'm really happy for you!!' Knew you would do well at your PhD you old genius you! Yes I am going to the fringe! When are you going? I'm going from the 22nd - 25th August - what are your plans? Yes that's the exact flight I was on!!!! That's so cool you could trace my flight!! Are you flying anywhere good this summer? What are your summer plans? Yes please come to London and let me know when you come! Me you and Charlie all still need to visit a random city in the UK at some point this summer! Xxx"
"20","Thanks for bringing the weather back with you by the way (unless it was rainy..). I'm going on the 11th - 14th of August! Is silly but I don't have any plans, am going with Rich G's parents (as Rich lives there now) and they reckon we will be able to do something, but if not will just be an expensive trip to Edinburgh haha! What are your plans? Not flying anywhere at the moment, am gunna do my Isle of Wight walk but still not booked it, literally only just be allowed the time off today! Don't think the city thing will happen as I got a message from Charlie today in the vain of I have absolutely no time free! And I am fairly similar but we'll see. Ergh, saw Rachel and her new guy earlier, they didn't see me but I feel pretty grrrr now haha! Xxx"
"21","So busy! When did we become adults with responsibilities!?! Haha. Oh dear is this the guy you showed me pictures of? How's your love life? as complicated as ever!? Xxx"
"22","Not real adults yet! Mid 20s is like the teenage years of adulthood!! Yeah it's the same guy, she massively downgraded. üòú Love life is non-existent now, just the way I want it to be. Xxx"
"23","At lunch today I had the petit filous convo with 6 scientists, none of them realised that it was cheese they all thought it was the same as yoghurt! Don't feel quite as stupid for liking cheese now haha!! Xxx"
"24","Hahaha it must be a scientist thing looool though you would have thought chemists would be clued up about these things!"
"25","Ha you like cheeeeeese"
"26","Cheese gromit?"
"27","Petit filous gromit?"
"28","Did you know the moon is made of petit filous"
"29","Wensleydale Gromit! Shhhhh don't tell that I like cheese, I am living a lie!"
"30","I am in love with Edinburgh. I need to move here."
"31","Ahhhh are you there at the moment? Edinburgh is so good! Let's plan to move there when you finish your PhD and I finish my OT training!!! How is the fringe!?! Xx"
"32","Yeahhh am here! Yesss let's we should totally move here, it's just so nice and pretty and cultured!! Fringe is so good but go home tomorrow which is sad üòû Saw a cool dystopian comedy play earlier, was awesomeee!! Xxx"
"33","You'll have to recommend things for me! Can't wait to go to the fringe!! How is life going? Xxx"
"34","Am not sure I know enough to recommend anything, but just saw the most 'amazing' show... We were the only ones in the audience but I did genuinely find it entertaining, it was called ""The Michael Gove Appreciation Society"" but it got cancelled and there was this old thespian who was just amazing but it was quite bad! Xxx"
"35","ich spreche nur f√ºr Sie in Deutsch ab sofort."
"36","Wow that's beautiful! Glad to see your practising your German although I'll have to google translate that! I'll learn some German when I get a chance so we can sail round Berlin like a breeze! How is the Isle of Wight? Looks like the weather is good for you :):) X"
"37","Am really not learning it haha, that's a Google Translate sentence, probably plagued with grammar errors! Is lovely thanks, think we've done the hardest bit now!! Xxx"
"38","Wow beautiful! I'm jealous! X"
"39","Done. That was a good 70km!! Am going to start looking up possible places in Berlin probably tomorrow! üòä You have Facebook... Would you look up for me what Charlie's relationship status is please?? Xxx"
"40","Haha Charlie's status is single so if you wana ask him out I think you have a chance üòú haaaa. Wow so much walking! Bet you're tired. Yay Berlin! Check out air bnb as they are good and in Berlin there might be cool trendy hostels too that would be cheap! üòÄ xxx"
"41","Oh me and Charlie are way past courting, was just wondering if he made us Facebook official yet.. :-P Yep will do!! Xxx"
"42","Hehe awwww memories! Still got my medal somewhere!"
"43","Need to get back into jazz guitar!"
"44","‚úàüè°üèòholiday sorted! Yaaaay! üòäüòéüëç"
"45","YAYYY!! üòé‚úåüõ´üõ¨‚õÑüòäüéÖ Am getting excited now! Xxx"
"46","I don't! Should I?"
"47","Been asking my sister for advice on Berlin! Here's a list of suggestions (will try adding them to the document later but it's not letting me atm! Film museum,"
"48","t at television tower,"
"49","ife under communism),"
"50","eum , Cookies and Creams veggie restaurant,"
"51","art,"

"60","http://www.spottedbylocals.com/berlin/"
"61","My cousin just shared this with me! There's a ""museum of things"" near where we're staying - there's just way too much to do! Xxx"
"62","Awesome!!!! Can't wait for Berlin!!!"
"63","https://youtu.be/AHLVM4MJgmo üòâ"
"64","Ahahahaga okay it's a real song then I guess...."
"65","I feel this is parallel to the electric guitar situation!"
"66","om/watch?v=2KNGhf6aMs4"
"67","Awww, hope you didn't cry this morning haha! But the kid gets a banjo at the end of the song... Maybe you'll get one?!?"
"68","Will see if I can actually do some stargazing tonight, unlike our failed attempt yesterday! Sorry that all our activities failed really haha!!"
"69","Will try and get a picture of the stars for you! üòä"
"70","Am pretty good at this stargazing malarkey üòú"
"71","Turn your phone brightness up if you can't see them, it's cool!! Excited!"
"72","I feel this somewhat makes up for stargazing last night, shame I am crap at ice skating and that we ate too early... üòú"
"73","I told you beetlejuice was a really star! Great pictures! Think it was a clearer night last night :)"
"74","I was pretty pleased, hence the number of pictures! And Beetlejuice is what I said it was - Betelgeuse!"
"75","Ahhhh ok maybe I was incorrect. Will have to look up the pronunciation of this elusive star! X"
"76","I need to look up WOMAD better.."
"77","Will book train tickets soon but might walk from the station if it's doabley"
"78","Doable sorry"
"79","Did you know that there is TREE CLIMBING at WOMAD?! I expect you to be well up for that."
"80","Hahaha the best bit about this video is the commentary! Looool! And yes yes yes the punk band has to happen!"
"81","New catchphrase: 'I don't have any core strength'. I am gunna start writing songs!"
"82","https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/river-stage-womad-2017"
"83","More workshops for you!"
"84","And freeeee"
"85","Noooooo this is the weekend I'm in Bristol! Boooo"
"86","One tribe!"
"87","One Tribe!"
"88","Aw cool! Are you there with your family? Hope you are having a good time! What bands are playing? Xx"
"89","Nope, wanted to go on my own, should've invited you really but it was a last minute decision! Jose Gonzalez is headlining, Josienne Clark and Ben Parker were pretty good as were Laucan. What you up to? Xxx"
"90","Laura Marling is on tomorrow night, but haven't bought tickets for tomorrow - did I tell you about the time I stalked her and she refused to let me into her gig...? Xxx"
"91","Haha are you serious? Did you really stalk Laura marling or is this one of those stories similar to you being a model!?!"
"92","No this isn't an artful lie, it's the truth! Was years ago, I went to her trailer and we had a chat over a cigarette, and I was like I can't get into the gig as I don't have a ticket and she basically said tough shit haha. Basically I failed at hitting on her!!"
"93","This was when she was going out with Marcus Mumford though"
"94","Maybe I should come tomorrow and give it another shot? I'd have more luck this time!"
"95","Haha yes always worth another shot!"
"96","Haha yesssss! What kind of music is it?"
"97","Earth liberation sounds!"
"98","Jazz, your favourite üòã IT'S HOT LIKE JAMAICA"
"99","I actually really love that song - definitely one of the best ones! I'm really enjoying it! How are you doing? Xx"
"100","I am cool like Kingston town! You?"
"101","Aka tired"
"102","When we going skiing by the way? Have decided I want to go."
"103","Yes yes yes for skiing! How about Christmas holidays like we did Berlin? Xx"
"104","We are the best holiday go-ers! Xxx"
"105","Yeah we are! üòä Although that seems like it would make sense, I actually think that the skiing season (in the alps anyway) is from my birthday onwards, I'll check it out! Christmas would be better for you I guess xxx"
"106","Rich! Sorry I missed your call last night. How are you doing? Let's catch up soon please! Xxx"
"107","Wow scary! How was the party? X"
"108","Fun thanks!"
"109","Is going on a holiday somewhere 27th-30th December any good for you or you busy then?"
"110","Hmm maybe. I am really struggling to get motivated to organise anything at the moment but I won't be home much over Christmas, and those days would be my few with my family, so not sure at the moment. I would like to though! We would have to come back earlier on the 30th though as am busy later on."
"111","Do you think if I ask really nicely they'll let me be a DJ on BBC Asian Network?"
"112","Spent 3 hours with Benjamin Zephaniah today ! So happy! Hope all is good with you! Xxx"
"113","Omg I was gunna text you on the train today, and now I'm on the train so you get a text. üòã How ARE youuu? Awesome stuff with Benji! Why were you with him? I'm great thanks, am in Brighton all week at a conference and I JUST GOT A FREE FIDGET SPINNER!!! I am really sad that we can't go on holiday this Christmas I'm really missing it üòû Next year we are doing it. Xxx"
"114","I hope he enjoys your fan girling hahaha!"
"115","Oi! What's your address? I have Xmas card to send you! Xx"
"116","Ruin the suspense of getting something through the mail why don't you? üòù If you are sending it soon then: 28 Bernard Road, Edgbaston, Birmingham, B17 8LP."
"117","Now I was 90% sure I had your address but turns out I don't! What is it? Xxx"
"118","69 Mackenzie road br3 4ry :) xx"
"119","Yep I thought it was 69.. Thanks!"
"120","Ps you around before Xmas at all for some fun Xmas activity? Maybe 23rd? It's a long shot that you're free but would be grrrreat to do something fun! Xx"
"121","I am actually in London on the 23rd.. Will reply properly in a bit"
"122","Cool! Evening time is good ! X"
"123","That'll be an issue"
"124","Yeah are you free a bit earlier in the day at all?! I am busy early evening from about 4pm... Xx"
"125","Ah, this could be tricky. You free Friday night?"
"126","Nope üòû Are you free on the 30th at all?!"
"127","To be honest I could be free whilst going home via London on Friday if you were able to come to Croydon or something but it wouldn't be for very long at all, and I wouldn't have a solid time for you!"
"128","That sounds like a bit of a rush. Probably best to leave it. Can I get back to you about the 30th - might be Hertfordshire! Xx"
"129","That is insane!"
"130","Lovin' Iros!"
"131","WELL DONE!! üòÉ And nice dancing, the older guy you did the dance with looked like he enjoyed it! My cousin said you are an expressive actor! How was it for you tonight? Your family came tonight right? I am just impressed I understood it all, never seen an opera before! Xxx"
"132","Sorry couldn't hang around after btw, we've got family around tomorrow morning and wanna get back! Xxx"
"133","Thank you so much for coming Rich! Hope you enjoyed it!? Where were you sitting? Was a good night...a few mistakes here and there but hopefully not too noticeable! Haha. No worries hope you have a nice time with your family and have a great weekend üòä xxx"
"134","Yes really did enjoy it!! I am really jealous, I'd love to do something like that! Haha no I didn't notice any mistakes but I wouldn't know what I'm looking for! I'm sure they weren't bad! Hard to explain where I was sitting as the stage is bloody round. You were directly in front of me where you start dancing near the beginning of the second act, but was right at the back at the top! I wanna see you properly, we need to get a date in the diary for February before it gets booked up, can you come up to Birmingham on the second weekend of Feb? Xxx"
"135","Morning! How you doing? Did the end of the run go well? Must feel strange to have it all done now. Know you haven't got back about Birmingham yet but we'll have to do that another time. I have decided to follow advice (you helped with this too when we spoke a while ago, so thanks!) and I'm taking a leave of absence from my PhD to focus on breaking cycles and getting better! I was kinda hanging on for that 'one last experiment' but luckily my supervisors talked me out of it and I'm already on leave as it all got signed off super quick! Anyway thought you'd like to know, I think it's a positive decision and feel surprisingly alright about it! üòä Xxx"
"136","Voice messages are really easy (and fun), will reply in a bit!"
"137","Damian Marley is playing at Brixton on 1st July! Shall we go?"
"138","A hundred times yes!! It's my Mum's birthday though, but I'll get around it! DAMIAN!"
"139","I'll send you the link after my lunch! Wooooo! Dream come true!"
"140","Have you finished lunch yet? üòú Question, do you want to go in to get a dog with me?"
"141","Ha I sent you a link to Damian over facebook!"
"142","How? I don't have Facebook?!"
"143","Ummmm you're still on messenger?!"
"144","Ergh something has gone wrong then."
"145","Sorry I missed your call rich. Bit busy on placement this week. Is everything ok?"
"146","Boom, booked!"
"147","¬£40 please!"
"148","Acc 08795919 sort 09-01-27"
"149","Thanks rich! Just transferred you the money! Yaaaaaay Damian Marley!"
"150","Ta! I'll let you know about dates when I can! WELCOME TO JAMROCK!"
"151","We should invite Joel Calder, he loves that song"
"152","Oh my gosh!! We actually should invite him! Maybe I'll drop him a message of Facebook!"
"153","Do it"
"154","Have't seen him for agessss"
"155","Happy International Women's Day! Though I don't agree that it should just be one day, it definitely shouldn't be needed in this day and age but whatever. Anyway, dates! I am free on Friday the 23rd but I will need somewhere to stay. Might be better to do the week after that, I am free any night on the week commencing the 26th except Wednesday, what suits you?"
"156","Could do the 26th?"
"157","Okay!"
"158","Happy Birthday Rich! Hope you have an amazing and wonderful day üòäüéàüéâ"
"159","Thank you!! üòä Xx"
"160","Are you at roundhouse?!?"
"161","Yeh think I said to you"
"162","This support act sucks"
"163","Yes I remember you saying! Who is supporting? Who are you seeing again?"
"164","I'm at roundhouse tomorrow!"
"165","Tomorrow just isn't good enough.. Seeing tUnE-yArDs. This support act is a shit Brazilian version of Tame Impala!"
"166","Mystic Braves are a good version of Tame Impala. Are you up for WOMAD again do you think? Most the festivals are shit this year and I wanna see Django Django!"
"167","We need to sort something!"
"168","What you doing tomorrow?"
"169","Young fathers?"
"170","Are you supporting them or..."
"171","So jealous you get to perform here"
"172","Just choir rehearsals tomorrow. Not sure I'm gonna be doing womad this year"
"173","Have a good night!"
"174","Oh damn we wanted free tickets üòã"
"175","Question two"
"176","Bloc Party in Berlin? C"
"177","Did you get the transcendental message I telepathically sent you last night? Because I really need to know that you are going to do what I asked? You are going to do it, right?"
"178","Haha I'm meditating on it - I only caught the first half of it though...these subliminal messages can sometimes have network issues"
"179","Ok I've resent, it was definitely clearer tonight. It's a pretty easy message to understand, not very long! You shouldn't have an issue with it, so I trust you'll ring them up tomorrow..."
"180","I dreamt last night that there was this decrepit old squirrel that we came across and it was basically dying. For some reason you were desperate to save it's life and we rung loads of animal charities to try and save it's life (which I thought was pointless), none of them helped at all... It died and you were upset üòù Though I'm confused because I'm sure in real life you don't like squirrels? Haha!"
"181","Haha that is hilarious! You are right, in real life I don't like squirrels! But you know I'm ever trying to become more compassionate to animal beings. I'm sad that your dream squirrel died though. I had a dream that I was on the train to farringdon but it was a loop line and went via Edinburgh. Your dream sounds much more fun!"
"182","Poor dream squirrel. Oh I dunno that dream sounds pretty fun, a darn sight better than a dream with you and a dying squirrel in it.. Hehe üòú"
"183","It was grim. It took so long to get to Farringdon but I had a huge chocolate cake that I was munching through en route!"
"184","Lollll am drinking with some random people in some place called Hinckley (?!) and just talking to someone and she went to Langley girls then boys for sixth form! So strange when that kinda thing happens!!"
"185","And now it's world war 3, WOOOO"
"186","Yo! I am getting into Euston at 12:33 tomorrow, I can swing by the Wellcome Library just after then and we can grab lunch on Charing Cross road. That good with you?"
"187","Rich! I thought this was tomorrow?!? I have an exam at uni today!!!"
"188","I said tomorrow"
"189","üòã"
"190","Reading it üòã"
"191","Read sorry"
"192","Oh yes! Haha sorry sounds perfect :)"
"193","Hahaha"
"194","Good luck with the presentation!"
"195","Thanks Rich!"
"196","Argh Rich I've just had a call from the doctors and I have to go for blood tests tomorrow so won't be able to make lunch. It might take a while you see. Is there any chance you can do Wednesday lunchtime? I'm sooooo sorry about this. So annoyed."
"197","Ah that's ashame! Nope Wednesday is no good for me üòû Your health is more important remember, we'll have to rearrange. How did the presentation go?"
"198","Argh it's so annoying as I was really looking forward to seeing you! The presentation went well! So relieved it's over and now just a few more projects and then I'm done. I'm going to a pottery class tonight lol! Hope it's relaxing! When are you next free? How did moving back to Birmingham go?"
"199","Yes I was looking forward to it too! Glad it went well üòä How was pottery? Pottery is pretty relaxed! I did something similar last night, putting together an ikea flat-pack! Haha no I've not moved back to Birmingham, but moved rooms, my room is so much bigger now. Not moving back for a while! I'm always free (apart from when I'm not).. I'm heading back to Birmingham next week, could coincide with that?"
"200","Oh yeah and have you done what I told you to do telepathically yet?!?"
"201","Ooh actually I might come up to cheer on the marathon on Sunday if the weather's nice too! Dunno yet thin"
"202","Thin meant to be though haha"
"203","Aw nooo I'm busy Sunday! Glad you moved rooms! Aw no my telepathic connections are a bit faulty at the moment xx"
"204","Fair dos you are always so busy at the weekends, I can never get a look in! You not free on Thursday lunchtime? How many times do I have to telepathically text you?! ü§£"
"205","Yes let's do Thursday! I can do Thursday evening too! Will you be in Beckenham area or in London? I'm not gonna be in London on Thursday but will be in Beckenham! Xxx"
"206","I just realised I may not have been particularly clear... I meant next Thursday, is that still okay? Or is that what you thought I meant haha?"
"207","I thought you meant this Thursday. I can do next Thursday in the evening?"
"208","Sorrry! Argh I can't do next Thursday evening!"
"209","I just don't know what keeps gone wrong! The telepathy just isn't working, nothing is getting through so here's the message: make yourself a GP appointment and go on meds. Then take them and stick on them, don't give them up. This is non-negotiable."
"210","Change of my plans! I'm heading back to Birmingham on Tuesday now, are you free for lunch or early dinner?"
"211","Also I would like you to reflect on yesterdays WhatsApp from me, it's certainly no magic instacure but it will help in the long run. I'm not going to keep going on about it unless you want to talk about it but I do think you should do it, you've really nothing to lose. Am saying it because I care. If it feels like an unthinkable thing to do to you then it's probably not a bad thing. Anyway, enough from me!"
"212","Thanks Rich, I really appreciate that. I'm at uni tomorrow...oh dear we aren't doing very well at this."
"213","How about Friday?"
"214","Or Sunday?"
"215","I can do Friday night?"
"216","Hi rich, thanks for your message. It's probably best to meet in Beckenham on Friday as not sure what time I'm gonna get in to central London. Why don't you come over at 7.15ish for dinner?"
"217","Okies! üòä"
"218","Hi rich! What foods do you eat/not eat? Trying to work out what to cook for us tomorrow! And remember you have a list of foods you don't like!"
"219","Cheese is the big one! But am eating way way more different varieties of food nowadays - if you have a dish in mind I can give you a thumbs up or down."
"220","Vegan bean chilli?"
"221","Yeah sounds great!"
"222","Thank you! üòÉ"
"223","Just learned that my brother partied with Jarvis Cocker and one of the Sex Pistols once in the 90s haha! Fun fact for you!"
"224","Aw awesome!"
"225","What time do we need to be at Charlie's tomorrow?"
"226","Haha good joke"
"227","No idea"
"228","Be there when we're there"
"229","Ha cool. Cos I was meant to cook our dinner tonight but I didn't manage too so will have to cook when I get back from uni tomorrow but it shouldn't take too long and I can pick up the ingredients on the way back home!"
"230","That's fine! No worries! üòä"
"231","Do you want some monies for them btw?"
"232","No no don't worry about money!"
"233","I'll be around in a few minutes!"
"234","Hello! Thanks for coming last night! üòä Sorry they were that drunk that early and we started the film so late/only semi watched it, hope you had some fun! You're always welcome to these things (if we haven't put you off coming completely haha) and was nice to see you üòä And thanks for dinner - I ended up eating one of those dreamy cat treats... It wasn't just me eating them and they actually weren't that bad but unbelievably salty!"
"235","Ellie!"
"236","Very very short notice as I've just seen it but do you wanna go to see Matthew Bourne's Cinderella in Wimbledon on Tuesday?"

"248","Aw no that sounds awesome but I've got my end of uni party on Friday!"

"257","My plan was literally to go and stand outside so I could hear him hahaha"
"258","Question of the day, whatever happened to Mumford and Sons? Feel like they just disappeared?"

"319","I am fuckedddddddddd"
"320","Aw that's really exciting. I can't come on Friday or Saturday but can come on Sunday and Monday x"
"321","Oh wow, last night I was a mess. That's what being fueled on alcohol, weed and Asian girls gets you. üòï"
"322","Damn not even Saturday evening? Am greedy for Ellie time!"
"323","You remember Jack Holland from sixth-form? Am on the way to Wembley to support him as he's captain of Bromley FC! And they are in the non league final at Wembley today! Big game"
"324","I don't remember Jack Holland. Ah cool, have fun x"
"325","He used to push me over playing football he was too strong haha"
"326","It went down to penalties and Jack missed the last one and lost Bromley the final haha"
"327","Hope you enjoyed Oxford today!"
"328","Do I need to book a train ticket to Worthing?"
"329","Nope, the prices are all the same doesn't matter when you buy a ticket"
"330","You are getting a ticket to Angmering which is another couple of stops on from Worthing"
"331","The train is from East Croydon and is direct with (get this) no engineering works (crazy)"
"332","I'm coming back with you on Monday as am heading back to Brum"
"333","Okies! Try to get to Angmering fairly early as we've got places to be on Sunday üòä"
"334","Cool! What's ze plan?"
"335","Also what's the weather forecast?"
"336","Also do you have your guitar with you at Worthing? We should do some singing in the evening!"
"337","You will experience ze plan when it's Sunday! I know the weather looks a bit off but will work around it, although it is a shame because it's just the most lovely place in the sun!"
"338","And yes I've got two guitars at my parents üé∂"
"339","Aw I've always wanted to try these too!"
"340","Imagine the colours when you are skating along! Mystical"
"341","I am thinking of cooking a sweet potato, chickpea and spinach curry on Sunday, is that ok? Have never tried it btw and don't have a recipe yet so could be a disaster..."
"342","Also you drink soya milk right?"
"343","I do indeed. And the curry sounds lovely."
"344","üòÑ"
"345","Oh btw the train to my parents divides at like Haywards Heath usually, make sure you get in the bit going towards Littlehampton"
"346","Top tip for you.."
"347","Oooh if you want on Monday we could go to All Points East in the Neighbourhood?"
"348","Monday is their gender equality day"
"349","So planning on getting the 9.33 from east Croydon which gets in at 10.46 to Angmering. Is that okay?"
"350","I have to be back for a big family dinner on Monday. So will need to leave on Monday by 4pm. X"
"351","Both sound great! üòä"
"352","Perfect. Btw do you have any good music recommendations? I'm in the need of a new band to listen to!"
"353","Protoje? Have you heard him?"
"354","Haven't heard of him! I'll give him a listen! I'm listening to the Stony Hill album by Damian Marley to prepare for July! Yeh man!"
"355","üëç"

"357","You'll like it"
"358","Yaaay!"

"360","Hey rich, do I need to bring anything in particular for the weekend?"
"361","Just yourself!"
"362","Do I need to bring a towel or do you have a spare one?"
"363","Also should I wear/pack suitable clothes for outdoorsy activities?"
"364","What's the weather forecast?"
"365","Got towels. Yeah I would wear some outdoorsy stuff, waterproof ones haha!"
"366","Haha. Brill. Yes just looked at the weather forecast...eeeek!"
"367","Well it's glorious atm...."
"368","Welcome to southern rail"
"369","It's cancelled, go to Brighton then change"
"370","Thanks for a lovely weekend Rich! Hope you get back to Birmingham ok'! I'm listening to the floods on the news - It sounds intense! Sounds like the worse of it is over though! Remember not to take the world on your shoulders and be so harsh on yourself. Your doing the right thing so just don't fret! Enjoy your book üòä"
"371","Argh just got in, 5 and a half hours door to door. üòû Have finally got my wet stuff off. Thank you for coming, was lovely to see you! Haha thanks, sorry about earlier it was kinda hitting me how difficult it all is, but thank you for highlighting it, I need to feel that pain, you are very kind. üòä Enjoy that Nike slogan"
"372","Haha! Are you sure it's not an old caravan? I hope you are having an ice cream! Xx"
"373","Ellie!"
"374","I have got cheap tickets to national theatre on Saturday!"
"375","Are you free?"
"376","You 100% can come this time if you say yes üòã"
"377","Hahaha! I am actually free on Saturday! What is it to see? Are you sure you're not going to back out if you get a better offer üòú"
"378","Seeing a play called Julie, don't know a lot about it but think it's about a girl whose just broken up and is going crazy with her decisions or something"
"379","It's Saturday evening! Can be your birthday present!"
"380","You are always the best offer."
"381","Hahahaha. Perfect! That sounds fun! What time is it?"
"382","19:30!"
"383","Oh shit I got a better offer..."
"384","Kidding!"
"385","Haha you better be kidding mister. It's in my diary now and my diary don't change! Haaaaa"
"386","Ellie's never changing pencil wrote it in there! You can't rub it out!"
"387","Yes my never changing pencil is magical"
"388","How are you doing?"
"389","Is your house repaired now?"
"390","Am good thanks! Really looking forward to tomorrow! I've got so much fun stuff planned for your birthday üòù"
"391","Ergh yeah it's kinda repaired but kinda not"
"392","The washing machine is bust and I am the only one dealing with it"
"393","Everyone else is too lazy but on the plus side I know a lot about washing machines now!"
"394","Think the flood waters clogged it up üòï"
"395","Haha! Yaaaay. Celebrate for me! Me and my family are going to an Escape Room"
"396","Washing machine knowledge will serve you well in life"
"397","Ah nice!"
"398","In fact I give you ultimate life points for sorting out the washing machine"
"399","Ellie ultimate life points is what I strive for üí™"
"400","And if any problems should befall any garment washing machinery I have in the future I will consult you"
"401","That's a lot of pressure..."
"402","OMG Benjamin!"
"403","Don't you mean a lot of water pressure?!?"
"404","üòúüòúüòú"
"405","Hoho '"
"406","Haaaaaa"
"407","You are quite the comedian"
"408","Also also also do you want to go dry slope skiing?"
"409","I've always wanted to try it!"
"410","Yes yes yes!"
"411","When do you wanna go?"
"412","Is there a slope in Birmingham or was it Manchester where you said about it before?"
"413","My phone battery is about to die so if I go off air that is why."
"414","But this conversation will be continued when I get some charge!"
"415","Brum"
"416","So yeah!"
"417","Yeh man! Let's go to Birmingham!"
"418","Let's do it!"
"419","My weekends are pretty free atm so could do 23rd June?"
"420","My weekends are less so üòú Could do that but I've got something else pencilled in that weekend but really don't think it'll happen"
"421","Can I let you know in a few days?"
"422","But use your regular pencil (the rubber outy one) and put it in for the moment"
"423","RICH! Thank you for the best birthday card ever! I LOVE hip hop dawg. Seriously it's so so kind of you :) and don't thank me for coming to Worthing...a big thank you to YOU for putting me up! Looking forward to our pencilled dry slope day! Just let me know when it can be changed to pen :) no worries if you can't make it - we will find a time we can both do :)"
"424","Haha the dawg is in the pound! Happy birthday!! Hope you have a fantastic day, you deserve a bit of fun! Enjoy escaping (or not as the case may be) and let me know how it is as I wanna try it so bad! üòä Looking forward to Saturday, if you are free beforehand we can go to a museum or something and grab dinner? No worries if you aren't."
"425","Sounds good, I'll be able to meet at like 3 or 4 if that's any good? Yes let's do a museum!"
"426","Sounds good to me! I'll have a think at what I want to see! Do you have any suggestions or burning desires?"
"427","Yay! I would like to see the Rodin exhibition at the British museum but that might be a bit expensive..."
"428","Hmmm I might need convincing..."
"429","Would it be possible for me to stay at yours please? üòï I am gunna be going back to my parents after the play but there's no trains when it'll be over."
"430","If you can't then I will try and find somewhere else"
"431","How was the escape room?"
"432","Ooo what's the band? Yes it's fine to stay but I'm up early on Sunday as out for the day so if you are ok getting up early?"
"433","How early is early?"
"434","But yeah should be fine!"
"435","Watched a few bands but Himalayas headlined!"
"436","Did you escape?"
"437","Like will need to leave around 9ish I think. Not sure yet."
"438","Yeah but did you escape?"
"439","Yes! Managed to escape! It was so so good."
"440","We got to walk through wardrobes and stuff!"
"441","Woweee"
"442","You should def go to one if you can!"
"443","Do you need a big crew to do one?"
"444","Yeh we went as a group of 6"
"445","Wouldn't really work with not many people"
"446","Sure!"
"447","The guy said that about a third of people who go don't get out!"
"448","Which is why I was worried you were still locked in there! üòú"
"449","Also feel free to say no but there is an open mic night at an art studio in Crystal Palace and I wana sing something but my guitar skills aren't up to speed...;do you fancy preparing a song to do (you guitar, me sing) at some point?"
"450","Yeah I'd love to! My guitar skills aren't exactly up to speed either but if I have a song to practise! üòä Let's do it!"
"451","Yes yes yes! I was thinking we could decide on a song and then practice it separately then come together and practice and maybe record as I have a super nice microphone! We could always set up a soundcloud account?"
"452","What kind of song did you want to do? My voice suits high thing - kind of folky as well."
"453","Any ideas?"
"454","Or we could always write a song or two?"
"455","The open mic night is on 22nd June...is that too far in advance?"
"456","I meant to say is that too soon?"
"457","I reckon we should do a song that has already been written and then build up a little track list!"
"458","Do you know Emmy the Great?"
"459","Afterglow of Rapture (paperforest) is a great song"
"460","Done my good deed for the day, elderly lady knocked off her mobility scooter by a car. Her leg was very broken, she is never walking again in my opinion. It pisses me off the amount of people that stand around watching but doing nothing."
"461","Anyway, the 22nd is way too soon. Yes i reckon folk! You are the folk master so yes I reckon we cover something and write something."
"462","I'll look up the songs!"
"463","And yes a sound cloud is a sound way to start"
"464","Shall we practice before the theatre on Saturday?"
"465","Yes! Let's practice on Saturday! Do you wana come over at like 3.30? Xx"
"466","Sure!"
"467","Also if you have any song suggestions let me know!"
"468","And let's be really focused. I've found in the past the temptation has been (given that both our minds work at like the speed of light and link in hundreds of directions) to do loads of things but say if we work on one or two songs and work on getting them really good I reckon that's a better way to go."
"469","And it will be really nice to have more of an impetus to practice :)"
"470","Yes ma'am"
"471","I should totally be a band manager"
"472","I can be like Murray in flight of the conchords!"
"473","Hahaha!"
"474","Omg why didn't I ask you?!"
"475","Do you wanna go see flight of the conchords at the o2 in a few weeks?"
"476","It's ¬£25 at the moment! Am so desperate to go."
"477","LETS GO!"
"478","I mean let's just do it"
"479","Yeah üòÉ"
"480","You are so up for stuff at the moment, this pleases me. üëç"
"481","It's because the rest of my life is so shit!"
"482","Haha"
"483","Oh so I'm the lowest of the low to go to then... I see..."
"484","Your life is what you make it"
"485","Noooooo what I meant was that basically when stuff is really hard, you need fun stuff to do to balance it out with :)"
"486","You always need fun stuff"
"487","The song dark eyes by bob Dylan is beautiful too! Obviously wanted sing it in his gravely voice but could do a sweet version!"
"488","Let's get a list together for tomorrow!"
"489","Ellie I think I took the wrong option..."
"490","I got drunk and lost at pool to some guy"
"491","I fucked up"
"492","Oh dear. It was going so well"
"493","Sorry!"
"494","I did get the bus and write shit down though!"
"495","Oh wait... No i didn't..."
"496","But I will have dinner üí™"
"497","Hi rich, sorry running late today. Is it ok if you came at 4? Not gonna be back for 3.30 xx"
"498","Phew here's a too much info text, I'm hiv negative yay! But on preventative medicine for it in case I got it yesterday, apparently I'm gunna feel horrible in a couple of hours..."
"499","Oh no - you well enough to go out?"
"500","I'm sure I'll be OK!"
"501","The doctor was the nicest guy! When I told him what we're seeing he was like, wow, be prepared.... Lollllll"
"502","Well at least it's negative. Is the medication really necessary? Is that what they recommended? Good to be on the safe side I guess!"
"503","When he realised I was an immunologist he asked me how the drugs he was about to prescribe me worked haha"
"504","Haha that's hilarious!"
"505","Oh they can't detect virus that's only just begun incubation so I am previously negative"
"506","Oh god, an intense play....that will be some light relief for us then!"
"507","I could be positive that's why they need to give the meds to prevent that happening üòû"
"508","Lol! Yeah good light relief"
"509","Oh cool, well that's good you got the drug. Will you need to go back for more tests then?"
"510","The virus would need time to infect my CD4s"
"511","Yeah I will after I'm done with the drugs"
"512","Cool. What time do you reckon you'll be at mine for?"
"513","But being on these drugs really reduces the chance of a virus taking hold, if there is any virus of course - quite interesting really haha!"
"514","I'm on a train, I ran"
"515","So about 20 mins?"
"516","I made some curry and got some Indian snacks for us to eat tonight before we go out"
"517","Yay!"
"518","Thank you!"
"519","üòÉ"
"520","Well the curry is left over from my dinner the other night"
"521","But there's enough for us to have"
"522","Haha"
"523","Cool"
"524","Brill see you soon"
"525","See ya in a bit"
"526","Is the play at 7.30? We will probably need to get the 18.41 train to Charing x. So leave mine at 18.30."
"527","Yes it is"
"528","Ok"
"529","Hi rich, how was the dog show? Thank you so much for coming down to London at the weekend and for the theatre. Sorry if I seemed a bit weird. You've been open with me so I'll be open with you. I'm finding everything very hard at the moment and am on risk watch as I pose a significant risk to myself and so found the play suicide a bit too close to home. I think that's why I went all analysing it - to kind of distance myself from it but realise it might have come across a bit ungrateful so I'm really sorry if it did! Really didn't want to be rude. The same with doing yoga in the morning - I hope you didn't think it was rude but it really is my life line for coping with stuff at the moment. Anyway wanted to explain so you didn't hate me! Sorry again! Hope you have a good time in Worthing this week xx"
"530","Morning! Ah the dog show was surprisingly good actually, I did get to pet some nice dogs and it wasn't very serious haha! Saw some pictures of the 100 years of suffrage in the Guardian, looked awesome did you enjoy it? First of all, just because I have been open with you doesn't mean you owe me anything. Although as one of your best friends I am very very glad you are being open, it gives me great comfort that you are able to do that and I really appreciate it! Such an improvement I am proud of you! üòä Secondly, woweee you have got completely the wrong end of the stick, you have nothing to apologise for!! You are such a grateful person, I didn't feel like you were ungrateful at all! I 100% expected you to analyse every part of it with your English Lit background, although I didn't realise that was the reason why. I do feel bad that I chose that play to see now to be honest, but I didn't know much about it or how you have been feeling so I guess it's one of those things. With yoga, I have also found it invaluable to help me cope at certain times so I completely get it! I know you do it every morning and thought nothing of it, you weren't being rude at all! To be honest the only thing I am offended by is what you just wrote ""explain so you didn't hate me"", I could never hate you. Ever. I care about you. You are so important to me, I just want you to know that I am always here for you for whatever you need - I am lucky as I know you are here for me too! üòä Xxx"
"531","Haha look what I found in the charity shop..."
"532","Hahaha amazing!! Was literally about to barrage you with some funny/interesting pictures so be prepared! Glad you enjoyed the parade, it's very positive that it was so busy! I believe in you! Hell you might not believe in you sometimes but I do. Yes it is all hard changes but there will be a positive outcome, it will just be so so hard in the meantime - you can deal with it, YOU CAN DO IT! JUST DO IT üòú lollllll"
"533","Have some pictures..."
"534","What a fit!"
"535","Ahahahaaaa these pictures made me laugh so much!"
"536","It's good to say if you don't understand something!"
"537","Haaaa good to know you loved beer in year 6!!"
"538","Your letter to santa was the best though...detailed instructions for where to leave the presents in your absence. Very practical"
"539","And I liked the thoughtful 'thanks by the way' comment added in there"
"540","It was crazy, Father Christmas actually found his way out to Amrica and I got some presents to our rented house haha"
"541","He's magic"
"542","Tonight is old photos..."
"543","Prepare yo self for some gangsta ass photos!"
"544","I was quite the happy chappy"
"545","Mum kept quite a few naked photos of me when I was young which I have ordered her to throw. Not impressed."
"546","You can unmute your phone now I'm done haha"
"547","AaaaaaaAwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww"
"548","You are so sweeeet!"
"549","What happened?!? Looool. Only joking"
"550","You can soooo tell its you in all these photos!"
"551","You were a very active child by the looks of things!"
"552","Hahahaha!!"
"553","You still good for next Saturday?!"
"554","Yes! How much is it? I'll have a look at trains!"
"555","Hmmm I just rang up the Birmingham one and it's ¬£25 per lesson for an hours skiing but they are fully booked this weekend. The Milton Keynes one is ¬£89 for three hours which is obviously more but that's for three hours! Personally I think we should plan it better for a few weeks in advance and book the Birmingham one and leave skiing this weekend. I was really looking forward to you coming up to stay though and the weather's gunna be glorious! Do you still wanna come up? I can help out with train tickets thought it won't be expensive!"
"556","Also can I be really cheeky and ask if I can maybe stay over Wednesday evening please? Feel completely ok to say no and if I did stay I would leave early! I am really struggling to find somewhere, it's looking like I'll have to pay ¬£100 for a travellodge at the moment üò• Basically my friend Atusa from Manchester is coming down, she's Iranian and loves football more than anything haha! You'd get on really really well with her, we're gunna watch the Iran game and it's gunna be great she is so fun, lovely and full of life!"
"557","Obviously the invite isn't subject to giving me somewhere to stay, even if I can't stay then pleaseee come along you are both really similar and would get along! üòÉ"
"558","Hi Rich, aw I'm so sorry but it's my sisters bday on Wednesday so we have family staying so there's no room and we are out all evening. I'll ask my mum but I really don't think there will be enough room. Sounds best to organise skiing for another weekend! Hope all is going well. Xxx"
"559","Don't worry at all! Hope she has a great day! üòÉ xxx"
"560","Haha I ‚ù§this!"
"561","You are a fantasic person Ellie, truely one of a kind! I care about you and will always be there for you. It's Friday sooo have a great weekend!! üòÑ"
"562","I hope you are watching England..."
"563","6-1!!!"
"564","Crazyyyyyy"
"565","It was a bit of a boring match because it was too easy!"

"651","I'll be in London all day Friday for the protest with almost certainly no friends so would love to meet with you guys, but if you don't want that or can't do that then no worries! üòä"
"652","Brill I'll text you deets once they are finalised"
"653","Cool! Only if you're sure? Don't wanna ruin your reunion!"

"657","Quote!"
"658","Hey Rich, so current plan is to meet outside Leicester Square TGI Friday's at 16.50 and then head to the rally but if you are going to the marches earlier just let us know where you are at around that time and then we can come find you or meet up then...just whatever is best. Anyway hope all is good!"

"675","Oh wow they look very fancy! You get to keep them yes?"
"676","Hehe! Are you having fun?!"
"677","Mixed fun but mostly yes! The setting is so amazing! The festival is very experimental, some amazing artists and others not so much! It is very much like a long conference instead of a festival in the way it's set up which can be tiring"
"678","Also not sure how I feel about the girl I'm seeing now, we'll see but I might end it soon üòû"
"679","Aw sounds a really different kind of experience! Ah why aren't you sure about the girl?"
"680","Rich! Are you free any weekend in September and fancy going to Go Ape?!?"
"681","Yeah I totz do!"
"682","The weekend of the 15th or the 22nd would be good!"
"683","Let's go on the 15th! Do you reckon we should go for the go Ape at battersea or at Cockfosters?"
"684","I have no idea which is better, will have a look"
"685","How did it go with your phone in the end?"
"686","I've decided to buy an iPhone SE outright and then get a sim only contract. God decisions decisions! How's Manchester?"
"687","Rich! You still up for Go Ape on the 15th? We should book!"
"688","Sorry I have been shit at replying, yes!"
"689","Was gonna ring you later"
"690","Brilliant! Do you reckon we should go for battersea park or Cockfosters?"
"691","Although Cockfosters might be better, I think Battersea as I need to get back that evening"
"692","Oh yeah also newsflash"
"693","Caffeine dependence goes yeah"
"694","I don't have any caffeine some days!"
"695","In fact, most days now. And it wasn't something I consciously stopped I just kinda didn't need it anymore! Now it is a treat!"
"696","Not a needed treat üòõ"

"698","Or ¬£32 in the Midlands"
"699","If you wanted to come up!"
"700","Thanks for looking this up Rich. I'm not sure I'm gonna be able to come up to the midlands - are you alright to come down for it? Do they have any 2.30 slots? If not 1.30 will be alright. Xx"
"701","Also thank you for the pep talk earlier and sorry for having a manic breakdown on you! Was so pleased to speak to you - you made me feel a lot better and more sane!"
"702","There's no 2:30 so I'll book for 1:30!"
"703","You didn't have a manic breakdown, but it does honestly upset me a bit to hear you talk about yourself like that! But please please please ring me anytime if you need cheering up or want a chat! üòÑ Even if I'm at work I'll make time üòä"
"704","Also I wanted to say please think about antidepressants, I know why you are against them but they put you in a level headspace eventually with time and they help in ways you don't even realise, there's nothing for you to lose."
"705","Cool! We are adventuring at 13:30 in Battersea! üòÅ"
"706","You owe me 36 big ones!"

"738","I might ring you when it all is less unbelievable!"
"739","It's all fine, just unbelievable situation and so so funny"

"741","I can't even explain"
"742","Hi rich, sorry I missed your call last night! Is everything ok? Got your voicemail....am free to speak this afternoon at 4 if you want xx"
"743","Oh yeah I'm fine! Am busy at 4pm! Xxx"
"744","Also I don't respond to things on Facebook, you'll have to send those links by snail mail I'm afraid."
"745","Ok you don't have to respond on Facebook but can you still access the links? We should probably book an air b n b or somewhere to stay soon!"
"746","Haha I'm kidding"
"747","Just not had time to look"

"878","I also might order the Naive super too as it sounds interesting!"
"879","Haha laughing so much that you were watching the Olympics haaaa"
"880","üòÑ"
"881","That's exactly the one I didn't want you to read, you are living that kind of shit at the moment, do you really need to read that at this moment in time? If want to buy it then fair enough! I'm just asking the question."
"882","It does look interesting though, but yes just querying you"
"883","Haha the same thought did cross my mind about Naive super!"
"884","Maybe I should get something to switch off from! Haha"
"885","Please do"

"908","Should cover it! üòä"
"909","Ok! I've worked out a basic itinerary, it's on the Google maps (but not necessarily in order). Haven't added everything but these are the main things! It's all very do able."
"910","We can play other bits by ear"
"911","Amazing! Thanks Rich. I'm addicted to Duolingo! It's the best thing ever!"

"922","Apparently the triposo app is good :) I'm going to download it!"
"923","Never heard of it but go for it!"
"924","So I feel like I would like to tell someone and you understand! I think I'm slipping up a bit with my recovery tbh, nothing major but I'm skipping meals a little bit the last couple of weeks. It's not like I've lost weight or gotten bad in other ways or anything but this isn't exactly ideal and I know it! I dunno I am going to really go back to making an effort as I had gone back to a less rigid mealplan from a 'you have to eat all these meals' model if that makes sense? Anyway yeah I feel like I just had to say to someone maybe so I'm accountable or something."
"925","I feel really bad though because I know you are struggling and we're obviously about to go away and I don't want it to effect you or worry you! I promise I am going to be really good and hey maybe sticking to something similar to your mealplan will help me when I'm away too."
"926","Fuck it, I'm gunna order a dominos #justdoit"
"927","I am also worried about my drinking habits atm but that's another story!"
"928","Hi rich, thanks so much for your message. I think it's really good to be honest and to tell me. I think it's so easy to skip meals and to tell yourself it's ok because 'xyz but the ED is a sneaky bugger and can use that to fuck up all the hard work you've done getting to stage where you are out of the shit that it created. It can be difficult to remember how bad things were when things are going better but that's almost when you have to be really honest with yourself and get back on track. Don't feel bad at all about telling me. I actually feel in a really good place with the food at the moment - I want to eat because I like it and it's good for me and I've spent so long fucking around with the meal plan and giving myself excuses that I'm bored with it and know where it leads. Let me know what would be helpful whilst we are away. It's probably good for us to eat the same things but it's also good to switch off from it all and for food to be food, like meals just happen and we can be present and enjoy Norway!"
"929","Also be careful with the drinking! I know from my own experience that I drop one behaviour only for another one to pop up and I had to give up drinking in my final year at York because I realised I was using it to block out things and avoid dealing with life (like an alcoholic) and to avoid feeling my feelings. Yet that's just me. You will be you and it's just a case of sitting down and being honest with yourself and how you are using it even when that's really uncomfortable."
"930","It's good to be aware of all this stuff but awareness won't do anything unless you follow it up with action"
"931","So ordering dominoes sounds like just what you need"
"932","Dominos was what I needed!"
"933","Thanks very much for being there! I am glad you are actually feeling good about food atm! Yeah I think that would be good whilst we're away! I am just a bit disappointed with myself as I wanted to be strong for you whilst being away and really I haven't been overly great recently and this is the worst it's been in months really (though it's really not that bad)!"
"934","Yeah the drinking is hard to explain, I just feel like I've needed a drink every night for quite a while, but haven't drunk tonight üòä The smoking was an issue for me a while back too but I haven't smoked for ages either, I think I was replacing things really!"
"935","Also another note I forget to tell you, I'm coming off my citalopram atm after chatting to the doctor and only just started doing that, don't think it'll effect me but I might be a bit side effecty though I don't know at this point!"
"936","You are actually strongest when you are honest about your vulnerabilities and what you find difficult so don't feel disappointed or feel like you should be a certain way. This is an illness. None of us chose it. It's about accepting that and releasing the notion that we can somehow control things. All we can do is decide each day to make positive choices that we know rationally will help us in the long run. And you've done that today"
"937","True üòä"
"938","The eating disorder is more than just what you do with food. That's just the tip. It's underneath, it's the thought processes and patterns. It's exhausting having to examine them but it also makes you more open to living a really vibrant and exciting life cos it means you break down patterns that would cut you off from experiencing the great things in life"
"939","Like connection with others, empathy, art, nature etc etc"
"940","Makes you really celebrate what being human is all about!"
"941","But you have to feel suffering to get to the good stuff"
"942","‚ò∫"
"943","True"
"944","All of this is true"
"945","Thank you!"
"946","It's because I'm basically the Buddha"
"947","Hahahaha"
"948","Ah I see"
"949","Hahahahaha"
"950","üßû‚Äç‚ôÇI'm a genie"
"951","Haha No I've got so much to learn but I've also realised I've learnt so much and however shit the last few years/months have been I wouldn't change it for the world because it's what I need!"
"952","Yay! I'll get my dusty lamp out!"
"953","Wow that's kinda how I feel"
"954","It's been crap"
"955","But I've learnt so much about everything"
"956","And overall yeah it has made me experience life differently"
"957","Yeah weird but not weird"
"958","Exactly!"
"959","So do something nice tonight and start again afresh tomorrow :) we always have the power to choose how we react to the day that confronts us!"
"960","I am watching a bollywood film called fight club"
"961","It is awful but what I need haha"
"962","Tomorrow is another day"
"963","Thanks so much for just being there, it so very appreciated you don't even know üòä"
"964","Ahaha brilliant"
"965","And you don't have to thank me - you've been there on countless occasions when I've been having my break downs!"
"966","And I will continue to be there."
"967","This film uses the crazy frog song an awful lot"
"968","Ellie I've just remembered we need to print out our boarding passes there and back or we can get charged by Ryanair"
"969","Because they are absolute tools."
"970","Oh yeah. I'll do it on Saturday night"
"971","I'm out in the day on Saturday so is it ok if you come over a bit later? Maybe at like 7? Xx"
"972","I guess so, I'll sit on my own all day üòú"
"973","Aaaah that makes me feel guilty!"
"974","üòû"
"975","I'll be sad and alone all day"
"976","And cold too"
"977","Too much gin!"
"978","I might be a bit hungover tomorrow..."
"979","I'm currently parading round London trying to find a night bus home"
"980","Hahaha"
"981","Norway!"
"982","I am very hungover"
"983","Went to Oktoberfest in Stratford, I feel horrid."
"984","What did you do last night?"
"985","Apparently I missed 6 calls and got 3 voice mails last night, I remember none of that.... I was gone"
"986","Got it. The two things that will sort me out today are a nice long shower and maccies in penge."
"987","My housemate just put a picture of the fjord islands on instagram, they look amazing"
"988","We got cut off! That sounds such a good shout."
"989","And Norway looks absolutely beautiful- I am soooo excited!"
"990","Arfgghh"
"991","There's a bus replacement to Stansted tomorrow..."
"992","Gotta leave even earlier now üòû"
"993","Shiiitttt!"
"994","What time do you reckon we need to leave?!"
"995","Early."
"996","Like how early?"
"997","I'm running really behind schedule!"
"998","Dunno"
"999","I'll look it up"
"1000","I'm checking in to Ryan Air now - will you send me your passport details?"
"1001","I'm looking up stansted too! So is plan to get uber to central London and then bus/train?"

"1007","Hehehe üòú"
"1008","Btw - we are going to have to put our main bags into the hold when we arrive at the airport cos i haven't paid for priority cabin bags"
"1009","No"
"1010","No"
"1011","No"
"1012","Yes yes yes"
"1013","Why?"
"1014","Me and my mum have literally just sat down for like an hour and worked out Ryan airs policy"
"1015","And?"
"1016","It hasn't changed in the last month has it?"
"1017","Because I was fine going to Poland"
"1018","Just queued up early"
"1019","Well you read it but basically we have to put it in hold"
"1020","Sorry first picture is blurry"
"1021","That to me sounds like you can bring a bag on!"
"1022","We'll place a bet"
"1023","Yes but only a small one!!!"
"1024","Well I'm placing my bag in the hold"
"1025","Sure beans!"
"1026","But they do that after you've gone through to board"
"1027","And only if they flag your bag as being too big!"
"1028","üòõ"
"1029","Am on the bus from Bromley!"
"1030","Cool! See you soon!"
"1031","These guys are excellent!!"

"1052","Rich!!!! Sorry I was asleep when you left...I've just woken up! (Lay in accomplished I guess...) How did you sleep? How is getting back to Birmingham this morning? Hope you are not too tired? A huge huge thank you for an amazing holiday! Thank you for being so great with organising things and for taking responsibility to find our way around - you were very good at putting up with my moodiness (sorry about the journey home and bits of the holiday when I got tired! Hope I wasn't too much of an arse - feeling tired and learning to rest is something that's slightly new to me!). Basically thanks for being very great. Hovedoya! Hope work isn't too hectic today and that you manage to rest up. Alsoooo enjoy playing with your lego tonight. I expect pictures of your husky dog. Ha ha. Thanks for helping me get home last night, sorry I couldn't say bye this morning. I'm so tired I can't even do yoga! Today is going to be very unproductive I think. As Norwegians would say ha en fin dag! Xxxx"
"1053","Ello Ellie! I am very very glad you were asleep to be honest, means you get to have that rest you deserve üòä You don't HAVE to do yoga every day haha! I'm in Coventry already, gunna make my meeting haha! I slept really well and am feeling ready to go - if I had been feeling awful I probably would still be at yours but I felt great this morning, well rested. Thank you for also organising it and suggesting it! üòÑ Bloody hell you weren't an arse, you were as good as gold! And if you get tired that's okay, everyone does, don't even think about it!"
"1054","And you mean h√∏vedoya! üòõ Xxx"

"1056","Also the last Part of the Ice Palace is really good"
"1057","Haha love this!"

"1059","Ahhhh and I haven't finished ice palace yet! Will do it today :)"
"1060","Never beats him!"
"1061","I am nearly there but not quite"
"1062","I am so so so tired now though it's unbelievable, only got home less than an hour ago üòû"
"1063","Yaaay lego! Rich you must be absolutely exhausted! Please please please get an early night and lots of rest!"
"1064","How did work go today?"
"1065","Ps my parents have been singing your praises all day ha ha"
"1066","Phew I've done all my jobs tonight so yes bed time now, am zonked! Work was good just very long - my ChaGo-K-1 cells weren't too happy I was away though haha!"
"1067","Aww they are such lovely people üòä"
"1068","Next Saturday night we're sending you back to the future!"
"1069","Haha did you finish watching it?"
"1070","I'm unpacking space pack but don't know if I'm ever going to use it again üòû"
"1071","I mean...it's not really my look!"
"1072","Maybe it could be my new one!"
"1073","The irony of receiving an email from Ryan Air asking how my airport experience was! Ha ha"
"1074","Never flying with Ryan Air again!!!"
"1075","Nope didn't finish watching it! Please watch it at some point!"
"1076","Space pack is an icon."
"1077","Yeah I'm never flying Ryan Air again, that was the straw that broke the camals back üòï"
"1078","https://youtu.be/Zs61EodGL-E"
"1079","Hahaha I know it's an advert for a company but made me laugh!"
"1080","Phew!"
"1081","The Nobel Peace Prize has gone to Denis Mukwege and Nadia Murad!"
"1082","For opposing sexual violence focused on a conflict setting"
"1083","Was reading this morning on the guardian that Trump or Kim Jong Un were in the running, would've been pissed if it went to them!"
"1084","That's such good news! A woman and people of diversity!"
"1085","I can't believe that Trump and Kim Jong Un were even nominated - that is a slightly terrifying prospect"
"1086","And so ironic given the current exhibition about nuclear disarmament!"
"1087","Well ironic if they'd won!"
"1088","Shocking nominators"
"1089","Chose one or two..."
"1090","Just talked to a geologist"
"1091","Can confirm that the rocks on hoved√∏ya have slipped"
"1092","üëç"
"1093","‚ù§"
"1094","My gosh that's amazing! Well done it looks great!"
"1095","Took me aaaages!"
"1096","I can see why that was hard"
"1097","I bet it took a while"
"1098","Haha yeh! Do you think that I could have an exhibition at the astrup museum! Ha ha"
"1099","I have just put some Oslo photos on Facebook btw!"
"1100","Erm, maybe with some practise... üòú and some more pieces..."
"1101","Oooo I shall check them out!"
"1102","Haha watch this space...it's the start of something beautiful!"
"1103","You finished Ice Palace yet?"
"1104","Yes! I have finished it! Have you? What did you think?"
"1105","Yep, I enjoyed it and has motivated me to get reading again to relax and not just for work! Definitely a lot to analyse, was so metaphorical but we knew that anyway. I am not sure I understand the woodwind players bit?!"
"1106","What did you think?"
"1107","Haha yeh I was a bit confused with the woodwind players too!"
"1108","I mean I guess you can analyse them in any way you want but I thought they added a kind of weird beauty to the otherwise desolate scenery"
"1109","I thought siss' relationship with the unnamed boy was interesting too!"
"1110","I thought it was interesting how none of the other characters had names other than Siss and Unn. They were just called 'auntie' or 'boy' or 'men'"
"1111","Haha yeah I found all of that interesting as well! I found especially interesting the relationship between Auntie and Siss compared to Mother/father and Siss!"
"1112","It was a pretty interesting take on survivors syndrome"
"1113","Especially as this relationship between Unn and Siss is so short yet intense"
"1114","Also David Bowie news tomorrow on BBC breakfast apparently... Bit odd!"
"1115","Wow I like this scissor thing!"
"1116","Haha what's the David Bowie news?"
"1117","Space Odyssey!"
"1118","I was hoping the Bowie news was that the BBC was announcing that he would rise from the dead but sadly not"
"1119","They are making a new long documentary on his life and also broadcasting his entire Glastonbury set from 2000 (apparently they only broadcast half an hour at the time) and it's iconic apparently"
"1120","Wow!"
"1121","I wana go to Glasto but didn't enter for tickets :("
"1122","Maybe I'll do oxfam stewarding!"
"1123","Oh and I was talking to Maddie last night and she said that all the other Nobel prizes are given out in Stockholm!"
"1124","So that's why there weren't separate museums for those prizes"
"1125","Can't believe this time last week we were in Oslo!"
"1126","Has gone so fast!"
"1127","I tried but yes I failed - think I'll oxfam or try to volunteer for cancer research UK!"
"1128","Yep I did know that!"
"1129","Tell me about it, has gone so quick"
"1130","First day back full time today!"
"1131","Awww good luck! You'll smash it!"
"1132","I'm having fun today so far! Am super motivated for some reason üòÉ"
"1133","It's vegan week on Bake Off!!"
"1134","OMG üò≤ I'm gonna watch it tonight. Exciting times"
"1135","Even more exciting I just made two cups of tea and had them both at once, revolutionary."
"1136","Next week on Bake Off is Nordic week!! üòÆ"
"1137","Clue is to really read and think about the question, the answer is in the question..."
"1138","Oooo I like this riddle....I feel like the answer should be some sort of invention of some kind - like a steam train or something...?"
"1139","Go space pack go!"
"1140","190 miles of steam train... Try again, and think about buildings. You have one more chance!"
"1141","Here‚Äôs a song for you‚Ä¶ Red Red Wine by UB40"
"1142","y.com/track/1tOE1dIyIjsfLJWiQ4ZRJW?si=5SwteFRLRK-Ced-PLAW_nQ"
"1143","Listen to this version of Red Red Wine for the best or worst (can't decide) rap you've ever heard"
"1144","Haha I had heard this rap version before! I feel like this is a rap I could get behind!"
"1145","Totz is! Lyrical genius!"
"1146","I have been trying to think of a title for my public talk on cancer - I think 'Cancer - The Mr Hyde To Our Dr Jekyll' is perhaps too pretentious and overkill üòù"
"1147","Lollll"
"1148","Haha I like it! Feel you can inject some culture into the science talk!"
"1149","I'm on my first night out clubbing in like years tonight"
"1150","Woahhh crazy cool!"
"1151","Where you going clubbing? üòÆ"
"1152","Hahaha just seen your WhatsApp pic! Unicorn!"

"1156","They are bloody brilliant!"
"1157","Hoho get you with the band suggestions!"
"1158","Good thanks, am at the railway pub quiz lol not done this for years!"

"1163","You didn't say where you went clubbing?! Was it good?"
"1164","Went to Heaven!"
"1165","It was gooooood!"
"1166","But my friend made me join tinder!"
"1167","I've been on it for three days! It's sooooo addictive!"
"1168","Oh I see, that makes sense now! Glad you had fun üòä"
"1169","Oh dear... Are you really in a good place for Tinder? I have deleted all my dating apps now and much happier for it!"
"1170","Perhaps but it's also a bit of a downer for guys like me! üòû"
"1171","Listening to phosphorescent, am enjoying so far!"
"1172","They're good right?!"
"1173","Noooo  I'm probably really not in the place for dating but I feel like I've never done this kind of thing so maybe just need to get it out my system"
"1174","So far it's quite good for my self esteem but I know I have to be careful"
"1175","Just treating it as having fun atm"
"1176","And getting into some weird and interesting conversations!"
"1177","Did I tell you about my Christopher Robin conversation on Tinder?"
"1178","Aye"
"1179","Please just be mindful!"
"1180","Amazing! You're in Berlin! So exciting! When do you see bloc party?"

"1183","And Bloc Party were the best gig I've been to for years, the crowd loved it"
"1184","üòÑ"
"1185","It looks like you're having the best time in Berlin!!!"
"1186","You're doing the nights out and the club scene that we never did!"
"1187","How is Berlin!? Are you doing any more things that we didn't do?"
"1188","Can't hear the sound on this but it looks beautiful! How was Berlin?"
"1189","Soz I was being a bit quiet! WAS AWESOMEEEEEEE"

"1196","He was talking about feminism today and about how he is a feminist..."
"1197","Mooooooooooooomins!!! What a great moomin drawing üòä Thank you so much for the card, I just got in and opened it!! It's lovely! You are lovely! You are 100% right, I really struggled with the calligraphy, I'm glad you translated it üòù but you are right, I am tough, so are you. I didn't win a poster competition at a conference today but I don't care and don't feel bad because guess what? I'm not perfect, and I don't need to be the best, I am great just as I am! üòä That dream is crazy cool!! I have never read moomins books, only ever watched the TV show - just listened to the theme tune which brings back memories! I'll give 'um a read!"

"1218","Might have to do it when I'm going back to Brum or when I'm back in Brum as it's easier to get to you from there vs here!"
"1219","Ah nooo - what about Friday night?"
"1220","I'm busy the next two Friday evenings! üòï"
